## Contributing

Wanna help? Cool! It will be really apreciated :)

`nar` is completely written in LiveScript language.
Take a look to the language [documentation][livescript] if you are new with it.
and follow the LiveScript language conventions defined in the [coding style guide][coding-style]

You must add new test cases for any new feature or refactor you do,
always following the same design/code patterns that already exist

### Development

Only [node.js](http://nodejs.org) is required for development
